This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

This will start the project and open a browser window.
Make sure to run the repository for the server before hand located from `wmollenkopf/fcards-server`
If running from two separate hosts you'll want to change localhost to the other address.

Please note, this project is still currently in development as a personal project, and am currently working on polishing up the code, this README.md etc in my spare time.

Also note:
```javascript
{fcardServerURL: `https://fcards-server.biri.me`}
```

The `fcardServerURL` used is defaulted now to a live server (as of this commit) but it could be replaced with `http://localhost:3000` etc -- depending on where the fcards-server is being hosted for the API access.
